# 🚦 AATOS – Artificially Augmented Traffic Observation System

## 📌 Overview
AATOS is a **smart traffic management system** that uses **YOLOv11 for car detection** and provides **dynamic traffic signal control** at a 4-way junction.

- 🚗 Vehicle detection using **YOLOv11**
- ⏱️ Variable green light timing based on traffic density
- 🤖 Optional **LLM-powered decision making** for adaptive policies
- 🔧 Future-ready for **hardware integration (Raspberry Pi/Arduino + LEDs)**
